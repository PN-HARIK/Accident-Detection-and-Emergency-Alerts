Real-Time Accident Detection System
This project implements a real-time accident detection system using Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network). It processes video streams to detect vehicular accidents and automatically sends emergency alerts via SMS using the Twilio API.

Features
ðŸŽ¥ Real-time accident detection from video input

ðŸ¤– Deep learning model (Faster R-CNN) for accurate object detection

ðŸ“¦ PyTorch-based model loading and inference

ðŸ“² SMS alerts sent via Twilio when an accident is detected

ðŸ›‘ Cooldown mechanism to prevent alert spamming
